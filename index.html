                <p>
                Grew Up in a small town had great parents and still have a great parent left that is my mother. My dad probably passed a year after the situation took place. Have a brother and who basically is my best friend.
                Went to all boys school for primary school and transferred to a co-ed school and a half in the high school that was in Grahamstown. As you can clearly 
                see I did 6 years at my high school due to complications I had no control over but still till today play an important role in my life as it is right now.
                The situation which made me miss the last 6 months of my original matric had me working harder then ever before just to appear normal.
                The experience definitely built what I call my foundations which were instilled by my parents but became more relevant when I facing different obstacles from this situation. 
                But it also showed me to enjoy my life to the fullest no matter being a dark time or happy time. 
                <br><br>
                I live by a motto that keeps me going when there are darks days, "NEC ASPERA TERRENT". Which simply means "Difficulties do not Dismay Us."
